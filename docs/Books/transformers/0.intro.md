[Transformers for Machine Learning - A Deep Dive](https://www.amazon.in/Transformers-Machine-Learning-Chapman-Recognition/dp/0367771659) is a comprehensive reference book that provides readers with an in-depth exploration of the Transformer Architecture.

Transformers have gone through many adaptations and alterations, resulting in newer techniques and methods. This is the first comprehensive book on transformers.

I have compiled these notes as a personal reference for my own study. I hope they will be of use to others.
