Hey, I am  Nithish Duvvuru. 

My journey began with a fascination for the intricacies of machine intelligence, evolving into a mastery of frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. I specialize in developing cutting-edge models for image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics, harnessing the power of deep neural networks to extract meaningful insights from vast datasets.


My expertise lies in developing advanced algorithms for optical character recognition (OCR), document classification, and information extraction. My work extends beyond model development, encompassing the orchestration of scalable and efficient infrastructures to deploy and manage sophisticated deep learning systems.
