The `threading` module in Python provides a way to create and manage threads, allowing you to write concurrent programs. Threads are lighter-weight than processes and share the same memory space, making them suitable for tasks that can be parallelized. Here's a brief introduction to the `threading` module:
###  **Thread**
    
- The `Thread` class is the core component of the `threading` module. You create threads by instantiating objects of this class.
- Example:
``` py
import threading
def my_function():
	# code to be executed in the thread

my_thread = threading.Thread(target=my_function)
```
###  **Thread Lifecycle**

The thread lifecycle in Python involves several states and transitions. Here's a detailed explanation of the different states a thread can go through in its lifecycle:

 -  New State:
    
	 - A thread is in the "New" state when it is created but not yet started. At this point, the thread has been instantiated but hasn't begun its execution.
	    
		``` py
		import threading
		
		def my_function():
			# Code to be executed in the thread
		
		my_thread = threading.Thread(target=my_function)  # Thread is in the "New" state
		```

-  Runnable/Ready State:
    
    - After a thread is created, it enters the "Runnable" or "Ready" state when the `start()` method is called. In this state, the thread is ready to run but may not have been scheduled by the operating system yet.
    
		```
		 my_thread.start()  # Thread is in the "Runnable" state
		```
    
-  Running State:
    
    - When the operating system scheduler assigns CPU time to the thread, it enters the "Running" state. In this state, the thread's `run()` method is being executed.

			```
			# Thread is in the "Running" state (while executing the run() method)
			```

-  Blocked/Waiting State:
    
    - A thread can move from the "Running" state to the "Blocked" or "Waiting" state when it is waiting for a resource, input, or some condition to be satisfied. It voluntarily releases the CPU.
		``` py
		import threading
		import time
		
		def my_function():
			with some_lock:
				time.sleep(5)  # Thread is in the "Blocked" state, waiting for some_lock
		

    
-  **Terminated State:**
    
    - A thread enters the "Terminated" state when its `run()` method completes or when an unhandled exception is raised within the thread. Once terminated, a thread cannot be restarted.
    
		```
		my_thread.join()
		```
		

It's important to note that the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) in CPython impacts the behavior of threads, especially in CPU-bound tasks. The GIL allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time, limiting the effectiveness of threads for parallelizing certain types of operations. For CPU-bound tasks, multiprocessing may be a more suitable alternative.

###  **Thread Synchronization:**

 Thread synchronization in Python is essential for managing access to shared resources and preventing data corruption in a multithreaded environment. The `threading` module provides several synchronization primitives to facilitate this. Here are some key mechanisms
		
- Locks
	- A Lock is the simplest synchronization primitive. It is used to enforce exclusive access to a shared resource.
	- Threads can acquire a lock using `acquire()` and release it using `release()`.
	- Example: 
		``` py
		import threading
		shared_resource = 0
		lock = threading.Lock()
		
		def increment():
			global shared_resource
			with lock:
				shared_resource += 1
		```

- Semaphores:
	- Semaphores are counters that control access to a resource. They are often used to limit the number of threads that can access a resource simultaneously.
	- The `Semaphore` class in the `threading` module provides this functionality.
	- Example:
		``` py
		import threading
		shared_resource = 0
		semaphore = threading.Semaphore(value=3)
		def increment():
			global shared_resource
			with semaphore:
				shared_resource += 1
		```

- Events 
	-  An `Event` is a simple signaling mechanism that allows one thread to notify others about a certain condition.
	- Threads can wait for an event using `wait()` and set the event using `set()`.
	- Example:
		``` py
		 import threading
		shared_condition = threading.Event()
		
		def wait_for_event():
			shared_condition.wait()
			# Continue with the task after the event is set
		
		def set_event():
			shared_condition.set()
		```

- Conditions 
	- A `Condition` is more advanced than an event and is often used to coordinate threads based on shared state.
	- It combines a lock and a signaling mechanism.
	- Example:
		``` py
		import threading
		
		shared_resource = 0
		condition = threading.Condition()
		
		def modify_resource():
			global shared_resource
			with condition:
				# Modify shared resource
				shared_resource += 1
				# Notify waiting threads
				condition.notify_all()
		
		def wait_for_change():
			with condition:
				while shared_resource == 0:
					condition.wait()
				# Continue the task after shared resource changes
		
		```
				

These synchronization primitives help ensure that critical sections of code are executed atomically and that threads cooperate properly when accessing shared data. The choice of synchronization mechanism depends on the specific requirements of your multithreaded application.

### **Thread pool**

Thread pools in Python provide a way to efficiently manage and reuse a fixed number of threads for executing tasks concurrently. The `concurrent.futures` module, introduced in Python 3.2, offers a high-level interface for working with thread pools through the `ThreadPoolExecutor` class. Here's a detailed explanation



- ThreadPoolExecutor:

	- The `ThreadPoolExecutor` class is part of the `concurrent.futures` module.
	- It provides a simple and consistent interface for working with thread pools.
	- To create a thread pool, you instantiate `ThreadPoolExecutor` with the desired number of worker threads


		``` py
		from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
		
		with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3) as executor:
			# Execute tasks using the executor
		
		```

- submit method:

	- The primary method of `ThreadPoolExecutor` is `submit(func, *args, **kwargs)`.
	- It schedules the given callable (function or method) to be executed asynchronously by a thread in the pool.
	- The method returns a `concurrent.futures.Future` object representing the result of the computation.
		``` py
		future = executor.submit(my_function, arg1, arg2)
		
		```

- map method:

	- The `map(func, *iterables, timeout=None)` method can be used to parallelize the execution of a function over multiple input values.
	- It's similar to the built-in `map` function but executes the function concurrently using the thread pool.
		``` py
		results = executor.map(my_function, iterable_of_args)
		```

- shutdown method:

	- To gracefully shut down the thread pool, you can use the `shutdown(wait=True)` method. The `wait` parameter specifies whether to wait for all submitted tasks to complete before shutting down.
		
		``` py
		executor.shutdown(wait=True)
		```

- handling Results 
	- The `concurrent.futures.Future` objects returned by `submit` can be used to retrieve the result of a computation.
    
	- You can check if a future is done using the `done()` method and retrieve the result using the `result()` method.
	
		``` py
		if future.done():
			result = future.result()
		
		```

- Exception Handling
	-  Exceptions raised in a thread are captured and re-raised when calling `result()` on the corresponding `Future` object.
	- It allows you to handle exceptions that occurred during the execution of a task
		``` py
		try:
			result = future.result()
		except Exception as e:
			# Handle the exception
		
		```

Thread pools are particularly useful for parallelizing I/O-bound tasks where threads can be efficiently reused. However, for CPU-bound tasks, consider using the `ProcessPoolExecutor` or other multiprocessing approaches due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPython.

###  **Daemon Threads**

A daemon thread is a thread that runs in the background and is subordinate to the main program. Daemon threads are typically used for tasks that don't need to be explicitly waited for or completed before the program exits. When the main program exits, any remaining daemon threads are abruptly terminated, regardless of whether they have finished their tasks or not.

- Creating Daemon Threads:

	- You can mark a thread as a daemon thread by setting its `daemon` attribute to `True` before starting it. The `setDaemon(True)` method can also be used.
		``` py
		import threading
		import time
		
		def daemon_function():
		    while True:
		        print("Daemon Thread is running...")
		        time.sleep(1)
		
		daemon_thread = threading.Thread(target=daemon_function)
		daemon_thread.setDaemon(True)  # Alternatively: daemon_thread.daemon = True
		daemon_thread.start()
		
		```

- Daemon vs. Non-Daemon Threads:
    - Non-daemon threads are considered foreground threads. The main program will wait for them to complete before it exits.
    - Daemon threads, on the other hand, are background threads. They do not prevent the main program from exiting, and if any daemon threads are still running when the program exits, they are abruptly terminated.
- Use Cases for Daemon Threads:
    - Daemon threads are suitable for background tasks such as monitoring, periodic cleanup, or tasks that should run indefinitely while the main program is running.
    - They are not suitable for tasks that need to be completed before the program exits since they might be terminated abruptly.
- Termination of Daemon Threads:
    - Daemon threads are terminated when the main program exits. This termination can be abrupt, potentially leading to incomplete tasks or resource leaks.
    - It's essential to ensure that daemon threads perform tasks that can be safely terminated at any point without causing issues.
- Joining Daemon Threads:
	- While daemon threads do not prevent the main program from exiting, you can still use the `join()` method to wait for a daemon thread to finish its current task before proceeding.
		``` py
		daemon_thread.join()
		```
- Default Daemon Status:

	- If you don't explicitly set the `daemon` attribute, threads are non-daemon by default.
		``` py
		default_thread = threading.Thread(target=some_function)  # This thread is non-daemon
		
		```
###  **Thread local**

Thread-local data is a mechanism that allows each thread to have its own instance of a variable, making it unique to that thread. This is particularly useful when working with threads that share the same global variables, as it prevents interference and data corruption between threads. The `threading` module provides the `local()` function to create thread-local data.

- The `local()` function creates an instance of a thread-local storage object. This object can hold variables that are unique to each thread.
	``` py
	import threading
	local_data = threading.local()
	```
- You can then assign variables to the thread-local object, and each thread will have its own independent copy of the variable
	``` py
	local_data.variable = 42
	```
- To access the thread-local data from within a thread, you simply use the thread-local object.
	``` py
	def my_function():
	    print(local_data.variable)
	
	my_thread = threading.Thread(target=my_function)
	my_thread.start()
	
	```
- By default, thread-local data is cleaned up when the thread exits. However, you can explicitly clean it up using the `del` statement.
	``` py
	del local_data
	```
- Uses
	- Thread-local data is often used when multiple threads need to work with shared resources, but each thread needs its own independent view of those resources.
	- It's beneficial in scenarios where global variables might be accessed and modified by multiple threads, and you want to avoid data corruption and race conditions
	``` py 
	import threading
	
	global_variable = 0
	lock = threading.Lock()
	
	def increment_global():
	    global global_variable
	    with lock:
	        global_variable += 1
	        print(f"Global variable value: {global_variable}")
	
	def thread_function():
	    local_data.local_variable = 100
	    increment_global()
	
	local_data = threading.local()
	
	my_thread = threading.Thread(target=thread_function)
	my_thread.start()
	```

###  **Conclusion**


In summary, the `threading` module provides a convenient way to work with threads in Python. It allows you to create, start, and manage threads, and includes features for synchronization and coordination between threads. Understanding these basics is crucial for developing concurrent and parallel programs in Python.
